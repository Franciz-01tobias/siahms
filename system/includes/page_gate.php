 * header.php makes the same two checks, but it is included in the middle of the
 * <body>, after the <head> has already been sent. By then header('Location')
 * can only raise "headers already sent" and the exit that follows leaves a
 * half-drawn page: a signed-out analyst saw a blank System page instead of the
 * login screen, and a non-admin saw one instead of being sent home. The checks
 * in header.php stay as a backstop; this is the one that can still redirect.
 *
 * Cosmetic like header.php's - the System APIs enforce admin themselves with
 * requireAdminJson().
