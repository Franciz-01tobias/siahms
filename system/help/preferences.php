        <div>
            <h3>What Preferences are</h3>
            <p>Preferences are <strong>personal to you</strong>, not system-wide. Changing one here only affects your own view — it never changes anything for other analysts.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>There are no Save or Apply buttons. Every control saves the moment you click it, and a brief confirmation or preview tells you it stuck.</p>
    <div class="help-note"><strong>Your settings travel with you.</strong> Choices are stored against your account, so they apply on any computer or browser you sign in from — not just the one you set them on.</div>
</div>

<!-- 2. Language -->
<div class="help-section" id="language">
    <div class="help-section-header"><?php echo helpSectionNum('language'); ?>
        <div>
            <h3>Interface language</h3>
            <p>Pick the language the interface is shown in. The dropdown lists every language FreeITSM ships translations for, with its language code alongside.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>When you choose a new language the page <strong>reloads</strong> so everything re-renders in your selection. Ticket content and other data you've entered are not translated — only the interface labels, menus and messages.</p>
</div>

<!-- 3. Notifications -->
<div class="help-section" id="toasts">
    <div class="help-section-header"><?php echo helpSectionNum('toasts'); ?>
        <div>
            <h3>Notifications (toasts)</h3>
            <p>Toasts are the small pop-up messages that confirm an action or report an error. Two settings control where they appear and how they move.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="help-cards">
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>Position</h4>
            <p>A 3&times;3 grid representing your screen. Click any of the nine cells — top/middle/bottom by left/centre/right — to choose the corner or edge toasts appear in. A sample toast previews your choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>Animation</h4>
            <p>Choose <strong>Slide</strong> (toasts glide in from the edge) or <strong>Fade</strong> (they fade in on the spot). A sample previews each.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="help-note">If you set these before they became account settings, your old per-browser choices are migrated to your account automatically the first time you open this page.</div>
</div>

<!-- 4. Left panels -->
<div class="help-section" id="panels">
    <div class="help-section-header"><?php echo helpSectionNum('panels'); ?>
        <div>
            <h3>Left-panel visibility</h3>
            <p>Several modules have a left-hand panel for navigation. This list gives you one toggle per module so you can decide, per module, whether that panel is always on screen or tucked away until you need it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Each toggle offers two modes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Always</strong> — the panel stays pinned open whenever you're in that module.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover</strong> — the panel collapses to reclaim space and slides out when you move the pointer to the edge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The modules with their own panel toggle here are Knowledge, Process Mapper, Contracts, Calendar, Tasks, CMDB, Change Management, Asset Management and System Wiki.</p>
    <div class="help-note">Where a module also has its own settings page, the same toggle lives there too — both edit the one setting, so changing it in either place has the same effect.</div>
</div>

<!-- 5. Display options -->
<div class="help-section" id="display">
    <div class="help-section-header"><?php echo helpSectionNum('display'); ?>
        <div>
            <h3>Display options</h3>
            <p>Small choices about how the screen behaves for you.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="help-cards">
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>Mission Control chart fill</h4>
            <p>Sets how charts on the Mission Control dashboard are filled: <strong>Plain</strong> (solid colour) or <strong>Gradient</strong> (a graded fill). Purely cosmetic — it changes the look, not the data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>Closing the search panel</h4>
            <p>The search panel in Tickets, Change Management, Problem Management and Contracts can be dragged out of the way and left open, so by default only its <strong>✕</strong> or the <strong>Escape</strong> key closes it. That suits searching once and then clicking down the results looking for the right ticket.</p>
            <p>Turn on <strong>Close it when I click away</strong> if you would rather it got out of the way on its own. It then closes as soon as you click the folder list, the ticket list or the toolbar. Clicking the ticket you just found — or its properties — leaves it open, so changing something on the ticket the search gave you does not throw the search away.</p>
            <p><strong>Escape always closes it</strong>, whichever way this is set.</p>

            <h4>Off, Add to my calendar, or Subscribe link</h4>
            <p><strong>Add to my calendar</strong> writes real appointments into your calendar and needs a connection set up by an administrator under <a href="calendar-sync.php">Calendar sync</a>. <strong>Subscribe link</strong> gives you a private link any calendar app can read, with nothing to set up.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>Which calendar</h4>
            <p>If your system has more than one calendar connection - Microsoft 365 and a CalDAV server, say - pick yours here. With only one there is nothing to choose. Moving to another takes your appointments out of the old calendar first.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="help-card">
            <h4>A CalDAV server</h4>
            <p>You sign in with your own calendar account, press <strong>Find</strong> and choose a calendar. An app password is the better choice where your server offers them. <strong>Forget</strong> takes the appointments back out and forgets the sign-in.</p>
