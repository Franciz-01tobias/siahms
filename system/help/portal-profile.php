            <h3>What this decides</h3>
            <p>Under <strong>My Account</strong> in the self-service portal, people can keep some of their own details up to date. This page decides which.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>The case for it is simple: a person knows their own phone number better than the service desk does, and a record they can correct themselves is a record that stays right. Under GDPR, people also have a right to have inaccurate details about them corrected (Article 16), and this is the easiest place to let them do it.</p>
    <div class="help-note"><strong>On a new or upgraded system, all four are ticked</strong>, which is what the portal has always offered. Nothing changes until you change it here.</div>

    <p>A detail you untick disappears from the portal form. Nothing already stored is removed, and your team can still change it on the person's record.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>People imported from LDAP or Active Directory:</strong> those details are shown read-only in the portal, with a note to ask IT. The next directory run would put back anything typed here, so the portal does not pretend otherwise.</li>
        <li><strong>A CardDAV address book:</strong> the same, <em>unless</em> you tick <strong>Let them change these too, and send their change to the address book</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="help-note warn"><strong>That setting lets your customers write into your address book.</strong> It is off by default for that reason. It only affects address books that already have <strong>Write changes back</strong> switched on under <a href="sso.php">Authentication</a>; the page lists which ones.</div>
    <p>With it on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The portal tells the person that their details also go to your address book.</li>
        <li><strong>Their change is sent first, and saved in FreeITSM only if the address book accepts it.</strong> If it does not - the server is unreachable, or somebody changed the same detail on the card since the last import - nothing is changed anywhere and the person is told. (An analyst's edit works the other way round, because an analyst can act on the warning and a customer cannot.)</li>
        <li>Only the details they actually changed are sent, and only those; photos, notes and everything else on the card are left alone.</li>
        <li>Every write appears in that address book's <strong>write log</strong>, marked as changed by the person themselves in the self-service portal.</li>
    </ul>
