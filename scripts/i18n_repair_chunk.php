 * i18n repair — fix the one malformation that keeps coming back, and only that one.

 *   php scripts/i18n_repair_chunk.php gu .i18n-work-2/chunks somewhere else

 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BETTER WARNING.
 *
 * A translation chunk is `key<TAB>value` per line. When the ENGLISH VALUE IS
 * EMPTY — a blank column header, a hint deliberately left unset — the correct
 * output is `key`, a tab, and nothing. There is nothing after the tab to make
 * the tab look necessary, so it gets dropped, and the line becomes a bare key
 * that the merge tool would silently discard.
 *
 * This happened FIVE times in one day, across five different agents, in two
 * languages. Every time on a blank-English key. Every time the agent's own
 * self-check reported success. The last one had a prompt explicitly naming the
 * failure, stating it had already happened four times, and instructing the agent
 * to grep its own output for tabless lines. It still happened.
 *
 * 🔑 So the conclusion is not "warn harder". It is that a tab followed by
 * nothing is not reliably producible, and the pipeline should repair it rather
 * than keep asking. There is no translation judgement involved: if English is
 * empty the translation is empty, necessarily and in every language.
 *
 * 🔴🔴 THE FRENCH RUN OF 2026-09-22 SETTLED IT. Thirteen agents, every prompt
 * naming the failure, stating it had already happened, and giving the exact
 * command to check with — `awk -F'\t' 'NF<2' <file>`. FOUR of the thirteen hit
 * it anyway, taking the running total from five to nine.
 *
 * The four split two and two, and the split is the whole lesson:
 *
 *   - TWO caught it themselves and genuinely repaired it before handing back
 *     (one re-added four stripped tabs in the SSO chunk with sed). Verified
 *     independently afterwards: really fixed.
 *   - TWO reported exactly the same thing and were WRONG. Each named the
 *     offending key in its hand-back, identified it correctly as the rule-6
 *     case, and stated it had run that exact command and seen it pass.
 *     `cat -A` showed no tab on either line.
 *
 * 🔑 So the finding is stronger than "agents forget". For this one fault the
 * agent's self-check is not merely unreliable, it is CONFIDENTLY WRONG — it
 * reports success on the very line it was watching, and reports it in the same
 * words as the agents that really did fix it. The two cases are indistinguish-
 * able from the report alone. A chunk's own verification claim therefore
 * carries NO weight here however specific it sounds, and no prompt wording
 * closes the gap: the rate did not fall as the instructions got better.
 *
 * Run this over every chunk before verifying, unconditionally, and never skip
 * it because a hand-back says the file is clean.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔑 THE MECHANISM, FOUND ON THE ELEVENTH OCCURRENCE — AND THE REAL FIX
 *
 * An agent on the nb run diagnosed it in one line: **the Write tool strips
 * trailing whitespace.** A line whose correct content is `key` + TAB + nothing
 * therefore cannot be written by that tool at all. The tab is removed after the
 * agent composes the line and before the bytes land on disk.
 *
 * That reframes every earlier finding. The agents were not careless, and the
 * two that "checked and were wrong" were not lying — they verified content they
 * had genuinely produced, and the tool discarded it on the way out. No prompt
 * wording could ever have fixed this, which is exactly what eleven attempts
 * demonstrated.
 *
 * 🔴 SO THE FIX IS NOT TO REPAIR IT, IT IS NOT TO ASK. As of 2026-09-22:
 *
 *   - i18n_chunk.php WITHHOLDS blank-English keys from chunks entirely.
 *   - i18n_merge.php FILLS them itself, because a blank English value has
 *     exactly one correct translation in every language.
 *
 * There are seven such keys in the whole product, and all eleven failures were
 * on those seven. This script remains the net for chunks generated before that
 * change, and for anything produced by hand — but the failure it was written
 * for can no longer occur through the normal pipeline.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE REFUSAL IS THE IMPORTANT HALF. A missing tab on a key whose English is
 * NOT empty means the agent lost a translation. Inserting a blank there would
 * convert a loud, catchable failure into a silent one — an empty string that
 * renders as nothing and never falls back to English. So that case is reported
 * and left alone, and the chunk still fails verification.
 *
 * There are currently 7 blank-valued keys in lang/en. Each is a landmine for
 * each of the 23 locales, so this runs before verification, every time.

             * Agents occasionally leak a fragment of their own tool-call syntax
             * into the file they are writing — a trailing `</content>` or
             * `</invoke>` on its own line. Seen twice: a French agent caught it

             * `key<TAB>value` and **a key never starts with `<`** — so a tabless
