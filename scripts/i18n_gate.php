 * i18n gate — catch English keys added since a baseline that no maintained locale has.
 *
 *   php scripts/i18n_gate.php                   since the last release tag
 *   php scripts/i18n_gate.php --since HEAD~1    since the previous commit
 *   php scripts/i18n_gate.php --since v2.2.0    since a named tag
 *   php scripts/i18n_gate.php --keys            list every offending key
 *   php scripts/i18n_gate.php --warn            report but always exit 0
 *
 * Exit 0 = nothing added, or everything added has been translated. Exit 1 = a gap
 * was introduced. Exit 2 = bad usage or git unavailable.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `i18n_audit.php` answers "how far behind is this locale?". That is the wrong
 * question to ask at commit time, because the answer is always "somewhat" and a
 * number that is always bad is a number nobody reads.
 *
 * This asks the one question that has a correct answer of zero: "did THIS change
 * make things worse?" A feature that adds thirty English strings silently knocks
 * every locale off parity, and nothing anywhere reports it — the fallback is
 * per-key and silent, so the new screen renders in English and looks finished.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-22: da, de, hi and pl had each been swept to 100% and had
 * all drifted back to 95.8%, every one of them missing THE SAME 347 keys. Those
 * keys were not a translation failure. They were features shipping without their
 * twins, five separate times, and being rediscovered by a full audit each time.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 🔑 WHY IT GATES ONLY THE *MAINTAINED* LOCALES, AND WHY THAT SET IS COMPUTED
 *
 * Thirteen locales currently sit around 35%. Demanding that a new key be present
 * in all 24 would fail on every commit, and a check that always fails is a check
 * that gets bypassed — which is how the real mismatch it would eventually catch
 * gets bypassed with it.
 *
 * So the gate applies to locales that were ALREADY CURRENT at the baseline, at
 * or above MAINTAINED_PCT of the baseline English. Coverage is measured against
 * the BASELINE, never against today's English — otherwise the new keys would
 * themselves drag a locale below the threshold and out of the set that is
 * supposed to catch them. That circularity would make the gate silently
 * self-disarming, which is worse than not having it.
 *
 * The set is computed rather than hard-coded so it strengthens by itself: a
 * locale swept to 100% joins the gated set on its next commit, with nobody
 * having to remember to add it to a list.
 *
 * ⚠️ It reports keys that are MISSING. It cannot tell you whether a translation
 * that is present is any good — `i18n_verify_chunk.php` checks structure and
 * only a reader of the language checks meaning.
