/**
 * Generate the portal's "Flow" background: three rotated ribbons of fine lines,
 * written to SVG so the page pays nothing to draw them.
 *
 * Run after changing any number in here:
 *   php scripts/gen_portal_flow.php
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE MATHS, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM
 *
 * Ed wrote an animated canvas version and asked for the same look without the
 * animation. Three things in his version do the heavy lifting, and all three
 * are ported here - the first was missing from the first attempt, which is why
 * that one read as a single flat sweep rather than folded fabric:
 *
 *  1. ROTATION. Each ribbon is rotated about its own centre, so the three cross
 *     at angles and read as in front of and behind one another. This is the one
 *     that turns a wave into a drawing.
 *
 *  2. TWO SUPERPOSED WAVES at different frequencies, travelling in opposite
 *     directions (2π forward, 4π back). Their periods do not divide evenly, so
 *     the combined shape never visibly repeats along the ribbon - which is what
 *     makes it look like cloth instead of a waveform.
 *
 *  3. ALPHA BY DISTANCE FROM THE RIBBON'S SPINE. Each ribbon is brightest down
 *     its centre and fades to its edges, so where two overlap the eye reads
 *     depth. Varying stroke WIDTH alone (the first attempt) does not do this.
 *
 * A fourth term, the envelope sin(πp), pinches each ribbon at its ends so the
 * lines converge rather than running off the edge squared.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY TWO FILES, AND WHY THE STRENGTH IS BAKED IN
 *
 * An SVG referenced from `background-image` is a separate document: it cannot
 * inherit the page's `currentColor`, and CSS gives no opacity control over a
 * background image. So light and dark get their own file, and each carries its
 * own group opacity. The alternative - a masked pseudo-element - is more
 * machinery than two small files deserve.
 *
 * SIZE IS A REAL CONSTRAINT. Ed's canvas draws 390 lines at 180 steps each,
 * which is free per frame but would be ~630KB as SVG. The counts below are
 * tuned to keep both files well under 100KB while holding the density that
 * makes the mesh read; coordinates are rounded to integers because at 1600px
 * wide a sub-pixel is invisible and the decimals were most of the file.
