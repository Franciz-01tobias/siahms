 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CATCHES IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER CHECK WE HAVE.
 *
 * `i18n_audit.php` compares each locale against `lang/en`. That is the right
 * question and it cannot see this one, because the failure is a gap in
 * `lang/en` ITSELF — a screen whose strings were never added to it.
 *
 * Found in the running product by the maintainer, not by tooling: the Spanish
 * Checklists screen was in English while the audit reported Spanish at 100%.
 * Both facts were true. `lang/en/checklists.php` held 70 help-page keys and 3
 * nav items, and the module's own screens — 2,011 lines across four files —
 * contained no t() call at all. Its help page had been internationalised and
 * the module never had been, so all 24 locales rendered it in English.
 *
 * 🔑 A locale cannot be more complete than its source. Coverage of `lang/en`
 * says nothing about coverage of the PRODUCT, and only this check asks that.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ IT FAILS ONLY ON THE UNAMBIGUOUS CASE: a file with several visible
 * strings and ZERO t() calls. A half-wired file is reported as a warning, not
 * a failure, because "some strings are hardcoded" is a judgement about which
 * ones, and a checker that argues about judgement gets switched off. Prefer
 * missing an exotic case to crying wolf on a common one.
