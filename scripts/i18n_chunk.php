 * Build the translation work list: every gap a locale has, split into chunks an

 *   php scripts/i18n_chunk.php hi                    one locale
 *   php scripts/i18n_chunk.php hi bn ta --max 260    several, custom chunk size
 *   php scripts/i18n_chunk.php --indian              the nine Indian locales
 *   php scripts/i18n_chunk.php hi --out C:/tmp/x     somewhere other than the default
 *
 * 🔑 CHUNKS ARE SPLIT BY TOP-LEVEL SECTION, not by counting to N and cutting.
 * A section is a screen, so a unit of work is coherent — the agent sees all the
 * strings for one dialogue at once and can make them read as a set. It also
 * means a failure loses a screen rather than half a module.
 *
 * ⚠️ A section larger than --max is NOT split. Cutting a screen in half to hit
 * an arbitrary number is how you get two halves translated in two registers.
 * The oversized ones are reported so the orchestrator can give them their own
 * agent rather than discovering it at merge time.
 *
 * Writes, under --out (default: the session's own directory):
 *   chunks/<locale>__<namespace>__<section>.en.tsv   the English to translate
 *   _worklist.json                                   what to fan out over

 * Read-only with respect to lang/. Writes nothing but chunk files.

/**
 * 🔴 BYTES ARE THE REAL LIMIT, NOT KEYS. Measured on the French run of
 * 2026-09-22, in the units i18nRowBytes() counts (key + tab + value + newline):
 *
 *   contracts.rfp   597 keys, 39,847 bytes, short labels   -> COMPLETED, ~2 min
 *   tickets.settings 629 keys, 59,934 bytes, mixed          -> AGENT KILLED
 *   tickets.help    358 keys, 63,787 bytes, help prose      -> AGENT KILLED
 *
 * Both deaths were the 64,000 output-token ceiling, and both agents were killed
 * before writing anything at all. Key count predicted neither: the 597-key
 * chunk survived and the 358-key one did not. Size predicted both.
 *
 * ⚠️ BUT SIZE WAS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGED. The re-split also added an
 * instruction: write the file once, and do not echo it back. Both deaths were
 * agents producing the same content twice. That confound was then resolved
 * deliberately, on the pt-BR run the same day: seven bundles packed to ~45 KB
 * — larger than one chunk that had died — WITH the write-once rule.
 *
 *   6 of 6 large bundles survived, at 44,007 to 44,996 bytes.
 *
 * 🔑 So the write-once instruction was the fix, not the smaller chunk. That is
 * why it now lives in scripts/i18n_BRIEF.md as its own section rather than in
 * an orchestrator's prompt: THIS LIMIT ASSUMES EVERY AGENT READS AND FOLLOWS
 * IT. If you translate without the brief, halve this number.
 *
 * 40,000 is under the 44,007 lowest proven survivor, with margin for prose
 * being costlier per byte than labels. 60 KB remains untested with the rule and
 * is not worth finding out on a real run: a chunk that dies costs a full re-run
 * and a manual split, while a chunk that is too small costs one more agent
 * re-reading the brief. Those are not comparable.

/**
 * 🔴 THE LIMIT ABOVE IS IN *ENGLISH* BYTES, BUT THE CEILING IS ON *OUTPUT*.
 * A locale whose script costs more bytes per character hits it sooner, and
 * 40,000 was calibrated entirely on Latin-script runs.
 *
 * Measured, output bytes per English byte, over whole completed locales:
 *
 *   nb  x1.04     Norwegian      Latin
 *   ms  x1.12     Malay          Latin
 *   fr  x1.18     French         Latin
 *   uk  x1.64     Ukrainian      Cyrillic, 2 bytes/char
 *   gu  x2.04     Gujarati       Indic, 3 bytes/char
 *   ml  x2.42     Malayalam      Indic, 3 bytes/char + long conjuncts
 *
 * A 45,000-byte English bundle is ~53 KB of French and ~109 KB of Malayalam.
 * That is exactly how a Malayalam agent was killed on the 64,000 output-token
 * ceiling after the same size had been completing comfortably in French,
 * Norwegian, Malay, Portuguese and Ukrainian.
 *
 * 🔑 So the budget is scaled by the locale's measured expansion, relative to
 * the Latin baseline the 40,000 was derived from. Unknown locales get the
 * Latin default, which is the safe direction to be wrong in only for Latin
 * scripts — add a measured figure before running a new script family.
