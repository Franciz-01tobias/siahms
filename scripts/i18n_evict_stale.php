 * Exit 0 = nothing to do, or done. Exit 1 = a locale was left unchanged because
 * the proof failed. Exit 2 = bad usage or git unavailable.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS — THE GAP THE REST OF THE PIPELINE CANNOT SEE
 *
 * `i18n_audit.php` counts keys a locale LACKS. `i18n_merge.php` never overwrites
 * a value that is already there. Both are right, and together they are blind to
 * the commonest way a finished locale goes wrong:
 *
 *     English changes, and the translation of the OLD English stays behind.
 *
 * The key is present, so nothing is missing. The value is non-empty, so nothing
 * is blank. Coverage still reads 100%. The screen is simply wrong, in a language
 * the person who changed the English does not read.
 *
 * It happened at scale here: renaming "SOP checklist" to "Checklist" across the
 * product changed 33 English values that twelve locales had already translated.
 * Every one of those locales went on saying "SOP-Checkliste", and every tool in
 * this directory reported them complete.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONLY SAFE FIX IS TO DELETE THE STALE TRANSLATION. A missing key falls
 * back to English, which is readable; a stale key renders confidently wrong text
 * and nothing will ever flag it. So this tool evicts, and the normal chunk →
 * translate → verify → merge path refills.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠️ IT REWRITES THE WHOLE FILE, AND THAT IS NOT FREE.
 *
 * Every file it touches is re-emitted from the parsed array, so it comes back
 * with the COMMENTS GONE and the `=>` alignment re-normalised. Evicting one
 * key from 24 locale files on 2026-09-23 produced a 3,191-insertion /
 * 3,463-deletion diff and stripped every explanatory comment those files had.
 *
 * 🔑 Its self-proof did not catch that, and could not: the proof compares
 * VALUES, and the values were all correct. What was lost was everything around
 * them. A check that only looks where you expect the damage will always say
 * the damage did not happen.
 *
 * So: for a SMALL eviction - one key, a handful of locales - remove the line
 * in place instead and leave the rest of the file byte-identical. Use this
 * tool when the eviction is large enough that a reformat is the lesser cost,
 * and read the diffstat before you commit either way.
 *
 * 🔴 IT DELETES REAL TRANSLATIONS, SO IT PROVES ITSELF BEFORE WRITING
 *
 * For every locale it flattens the file before and after and asserts:
 *
 *   - every key that disappeared is one it MEANT to evict, and
 *   - every key that remains is BYTE-IDENTICAL to what it was.
 *
 * If either fails the file is not written and the run exits non-zero. This is
 * the same shape as the merge tool's own non-destruction proof, for the same
 * reason: nobody will read 30,000 keys to check.
 *
 * ⚠️ A key whose English merely gained or lost whitespace is NOT evicted —
 * trimming a trailing space does not invalidate a translation, and evicting on
 * it would throw away good work every time somebody reformats a file.
