 * 🔴 THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER CHECK HERE
 *
 * FreeITSM's checklist settings screen offers a gate mode called **Standard**
 * (warn, do not block) and, a few lines below, marks a preset **(Default)**.
 * Two different English words for two unrelated things, so English reads fine.
 *
 * Danish, Norwegian, German and Portuguese all collapse both onto one word —
 * *standard*, *standard*, *Standard*, *padrão*. The screen then says "Standard"
 * meaning *warn, do not block* directly above "(standard)" meaning *this is the
 * preset*, and an administrator has no way to tell which is which.
 *
 * 🔑 **The defect does not exist in any single string.** Each translation is
 * correct on its own; the fault is only in the pair, and only because of where
 * the two land in the interface. So:
 *
 *   - `i18n_verify_chunk.php` cannot see it — it compares one line to one line.
 *   - `i18n_audit.php` cannot see it — nothing is missing.
 *   - `i18n_evict_stale.php` cannot see it — the English never changed.
 *   - A 100% coverage score cannot see it.
 *
 * Four of the first nine locales translated in one batch hit it, and only one
 * translator noticed unprompted. That is not carelessness: a translator is
 * given a chunk, not a screenshot, so the adjacency is genuinely not visible
 * from the work. A machine holding both keys at once can see it, which is the
 * only reason this file can exist.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT REPORTS, IT DOES NOT FIX. Which of the two words should change is a
 * judgement about the language — sometimes the gate should be renamed, more
 * often the preset marker. There is no safe automatic answer.

/**
 * The pairs worth checking, and why each one matters.
 *
 * Add a rule when English uses two DIFFERENT words for two DIFFERENT things
 * that a reader sees at the same time. Do not add one for strings that merely
 * appear in the same file — words repeat legitimately all over a locale, and a
 * check that cries wolf gets switched off.
 *
 *   a, b        dotted keys, each 'namespace.key'
 *   a_part      which part of a's value to compare (see below)
 *   b_part      likewise for b
 *   why         printed with any hit, so whoever reads the failure knows the
 *               adjacency without having to open the product
 *   allow       words that may legitimately appear in both
 *
 * ⚠️ COMPARE THE PARTS THAT CARRY THE MEANING, NOT WHOLE STRINGS. The first
 * version of this file intersected two whole values and reported six
 * collisions, every one of them false: both strings describe *warning*, so they
 * legitimately share "warn" / "advar" / "avisar" / "amaran". The words actually
 * at risk are the gate's NAME and the preset's MARKER, which in English are
 * "Standard" and "(Default)" — so compare the label before the bracket against
 * the text inside the brackets, and nothing else.
 *
 *   🔑 A guard with known noise gets switched off, and then it is not a guard.
 *   Six false positives on the first run was the whole rule's worth of warning.
 *
 * Parts:
 *   'label'  the text before the first "(" — "Standard (Warn & audit)" -> "Standard"
 *   'paren'  the text inside brackets — "Allow it (Default)" -> "Default"
 *   'all'    the whole value

 * list would have to hold 3,081 entries to say the same thing.
