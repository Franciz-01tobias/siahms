/**
 * Re-apply a CORRECTED chunk over values that were merged before it was fixed.
 *
 *   php scripts/i18n_resync_chunk.php ml <chunkDir> --dry-run
 *   php scripts/i18n_resync_chunk.php ml <chunkDir> --apply
 *
 * Exit 0 = nothing to do, or done. Exit 1 = refused. Exit 2 = bad usage.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `i18n_merge.php --force`
 *
 * `i18n_merge.php` NEVER overwrites an existing value, and that rule is load
 * bearing: a locale file holding a partial translation may hold work somebody
 * reviewed by hand, and a merge that could overwrite would put every one of
 * those at the mercy of the next machine-generated pass.
 *
 * But there is one case the rule leaves stranded. A chunk is merged, someone
 * then finds a defect in it, the translator corrects the TSV — and the merge
 * politely declines to apply the correction, because a value is already there.
 * The fix sits on disk and never reaches the product.
 *
 * That happened here: eight Malayalam chunks were merged, a deeper check then
 * found 23 values across two namespaces with HTML tags dropped, invented, or
 * entity-substituted. Six of those chunks had already merged.
 *
 * So this tool evicts exactly the keys whose live value DIFFERS from the
 * corrected chunk, and then the ordinary merge fills them. No new overwrite
 * path is introduced; the general rule stands.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CHUNK MUST HAVE PASSED `i18n_verify_chunk.php` FIRST. This tool does
 * not judge the translation - it only decides which keys are out of date. Run
 * it through the gate, or you will faithfully install the wrong text.
 *
 * 🔑 It compares the chunk against the LIVE FILE, not against a record of what
 * was merged. There is no state to get out of step: whatever the file says now
 * is what is compared, so running it twice is a no-op.
