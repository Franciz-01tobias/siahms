 * Forms — settings manifest. See includes/capabilities.php.

 * Reading submissions is the everyday job and stays on plain module access. Designing
 * forms is everyday work too, but it decides who approves a request, so since #180 it is
 * its own permission ('actions' below) that an install can switch on in the Access tab.
 * The AI tab uses the shared AI settings panel (namespace forms_ai).
