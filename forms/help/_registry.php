/**
 * Forms help — the topic registry.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY FORMS HAS TOPIC PAGES AT ALL. `forms/help.php` is one page with eight
 * sections and it was already the longest help guide in the product. Six more
 * areas landed in 2.3.0 — layout, blocks, tables, drafts and who may request a
 * form — and adding them as six more sections would have made a page nobody
 * reads to the bottom of. Ed's words: "maybe it should have its own help pages
 * so the help screen doesn't turn into war and peace."
 *
 * So the main guide keeps the basics and links here; each topic that needs real
 * explaining gets a page of its own.
 *
 * The registry owns each topic's title, standfirst and section list. The
 * sections drive BOTH the page's own sidebar and the cards on forms/help.php,
 * so a topic cannot list a section it does not have, and the guide cannot link
 * to a topic that does not exist.
 *
 * ADDING A TOPIC: add the entry here, then create <slug>.php which sets
 * $helpTopic and requires _top.php / _bottom.php. Nothing else to wire up.
 *
 * ⚠️ ENGLISH-ONLY AND INLINE, exactly as system/help/ is. A help topic is prose
 * rather than chrome, and putting whole paragraphs through the translation
 * layer would add several hundred keys per locale for text that nobody has
 * asked to have translated. The module's chrome IS translated, as it always was.
