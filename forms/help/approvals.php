<?php helpSection('setting', 'Asking for approval',
    'A catalogue form can wait for a yes before it becomes a ticket.'); ?>
    <p>On the Forms list, the shield on a form's row opens <strong>Approval settings</strong>. Tick <strong>Require approval before a ticket is raised</strong>, then choose <strong>Who decides</strong>: <em>A person</em> or <em>A team</em>.</p>
    <p>Approval only applies to requests made through the self-service portal. A member of staff filling the form in on the Forms page is never held up.</p>
    <div class="help-note">
        <strong>Nothing changes for a form you already have.</strong> A form with a named approver keeps working exactly as it did. A team is an extra choice, not a replacement.
    </div>
<?php helpSectionEnd(); ?>

<?php helpSection('person', 'A person decides',
    'One named member of staff approves or rejects, as before.'); ?>
    <p>Their first click decides the request. An administrator can also decide it.</p>
    <p><strong>The approver cannot approve a request they made themselves</strong> is an optional tick box, off unless you turn it on. FreeITSM matches on email address, so it applies when a member of staff requests through the portal with the same address they log in with. Their own requests then wait until an administrator moves them to someone else.</p>
<?php helpSectionEnd(); ?>

<?php helpSection('team', 'A team decides',
    'Several different members of a team must agree.'); ?>
    <p>Choose a team and set two numbers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approvals needed</strong> - how many different members must approve, for example 2.</li>
        <li><strong>Rejections needed to decline</strong> - how many must reject before the request is declined. It starts at 1, so one rejection stops it. Raise it if one person should not be able to block a request on their own.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each member votes once. Whichever number is reached first decides the request, and the ticket is raised once, however many people are clicking at the same moment. A rejection needs a reason.</p>
    <p>The person who made the request can never vote on it, even if they are in the team. If the window warns that the team is smaller than the approvals needed, its requests would get stuck - choose a bigger team or a smaller number.</p>
    <div class="help-note">
        <strong>Who is in the team is checked at every vote.</strong> Somebody who leaves the team can no longer vote on requests already waiting, and somebody who joins can. Votes already cast still count.
    </div>
<?php helpSectionEnd(); ?>

<?php helpSection('inbox', 'The approvals inbox',
    'Forms → Approvals lists what is waiting on you.'); ?>
    <p>A team request shows the team, how far it has got ("1 of 2 approvals") and every vote so far, with names, times and notes. Once you have voted it leaves <em>For me</em> and appears under <em>Decided by me</em>; it stays under <em>All pending</em> until it is decided.</p>
    <p>Team members do not need access to the Forms module to vote - being in a team that approves a form is enough to open the inbox.</p>
<?php helpSectionEnd(); ?>

<?php helpSection('admins', 'When an administrator steps in',
    'Override and Move, both with a reason, both written on the request.'); ?>
    <p><strong>An administrator's click is not a vote.</strong> On a team request, an administrator who is not voting sees a note saying their Approve or Reject <em>overrides</em> the team. The note box becomes the reason, and it must be filled in.</p>
    <p><strong>Move</strong> sends a waiting request to another team or a named person, again with a reason. The votes cast so far are kept on the record but no longer count, so the new approvers start from nothing.</p>
    <p>A request that cannot be decided any more - the team has emptied, or too few members are left to reach either number - is marked <strong>Stuck</strong>. It is never waved through on its own; an administrator moves or overrides it.</p>
    <p>Every override and move shows on the request's card with who did it, when and why.</p>
