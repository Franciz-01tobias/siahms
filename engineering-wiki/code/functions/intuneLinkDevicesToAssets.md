# intuneLinkDevicesToAssets()

Link intune_devices to assets, then create stub assets for any device still unlinked. Returns counts so the sync job message can show what happened.

🔑 AN EXISTING LINK IS TRUSTED, WHEREVER THE ASSET NOW IS (PR #164)

Multi-tenancy: Intune is a single MSP-level connection that can hold machines
from several client companies, so there is no per-key company to derive here
(unlike the agent ingest paths). The workflow this supports: a stub lands in
one company - the Default company unless Assets -> Settings -> Intune names
another - and an analyst MOVES it to the client it belongs to. A link made by
an earlier sync is therefore never second-guessed because its asset is now in
a different company: a person put it there. Doing otherwise cleared the link
of every moved machine and made a duplicate stub on the next sync.

The company setting decides only NEW things: which company's assets an
unlinked device may be matched to, and where a new stub goes. Unset - every
install after upgrade - matches across all companies, exactly as the old
hostname-only link did, and creates stubs in the Default company.

Matching itself is AssetsService::reconcileAsset(): serial first, then
hostname, with the placeholder-serial list and the laptop-refresh rule.
