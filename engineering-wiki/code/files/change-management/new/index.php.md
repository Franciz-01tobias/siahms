/change-management/new/ — pretty URL for creating a change.

This is a thin wrapper around ../index.php. We just set a sentinel
variable that the main page picks up to emit a JS bootstrap line, so
the editor opens straight away in create mode. All URLs in the page
are built via BASE_URL (defined in config.php) so depth doesn't
matter — every nav link, asset and API call still resolves correctly
even though the browser address bar reads /change-management/new/.
