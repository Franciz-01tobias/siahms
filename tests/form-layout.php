 * A form's LAYOUT — deriving one, and reconciling a stored one with the
 * questions that actually exist.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. Layout became its own object so that a form can be
 * re-laid-out without touching a question, and so that a cell designer can be
 * added later as a UI rather than a rewrite. Two things have to hold for that
 * to be safe, and neither would fail loudly:
 *
 *   1. A form with NO stored layout must derive exactly what it already draws.
 *      Every form that predates this stores NULL, so a wrong derivation would
 *      silently re-lay-out every existing form on every install.
 *
 *   2. A stored layout must never DROP a question. A field added or retired
 *      after the layout was saved is the case that matters: a field the layout
 *      does not mention would simply never render — the same silent-drop that
 *      an untaught field type used to cause, arriving by a different road.
