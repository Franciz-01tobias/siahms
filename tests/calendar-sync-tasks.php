 * Tasks in a calendar (#75) — the decisions, not the network.
 *
 * 🔑 NOTHING HERE TALKS TO MICROSOFT. What is worth testing is what the code
 * DECIDES: which of a task's two dates should be in whose calendar, what an
 * event looks like once built, and what happens at the edges. The provider is
 * a network call and belongs behind a live run, not a unit test.
 *
 * ⚠️ Touches the database. Everything it makes is named ZZCAL and removed in
 * the cleanup at the bottom, including on failure.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/calendar-sync-tasks.php
