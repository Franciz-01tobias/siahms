<?php
/**
 * Restricting a form to a group of people (GH #145, Benjamin).
 *
 * 🔴 WHAT HAS TO HOLD. A restriction is only worth the name if EVERY way in
 * enforces it. The catalogue hiding a card is not a check — somebody who was in
 * the group last week, or who has a colleague's link, arrives at the other
 * endpoints with a perfectly valid form id.
 *
 *   the catalogue list        — the form is not in it
 *   opening it by id          — 404, same as a form that does not exist
 *   saving a draft of it      — refused
 *   fetching its images       — 404
 *   SUBMITTING it             — refused in the service, not just the adapter
 *
 * 🔑 NO ROWS MEANS EVERYONE, and that is every form that predates this. The
 * first thing proved below is that an unrestricted form is unaffected, because
 * a restriction feature that quietly narrows existing forms is the worst
 * possible outcome.
 *
 * ⚠️ Runs against the real database. Everything is removed in the finally
 * block and the cleanup is asserted.
 *
 * Run: php tests/form-audiences.php
