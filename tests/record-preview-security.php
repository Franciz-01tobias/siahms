/**
 * Record previews (#91) — the security boundary.
 *
 * Ed asked whether a preview is "rock solid security wise — for example is
 * there a way a hacker could call the preview function unauthenticated". This
 * file is the answer, written as checks rather than as a claim.
 *
 * 🔴 A preview is a READ of a record the reader may not be entitled to. It is
 * reached from links, and a link can point anywhere. So the interesting question
 * is never "does it work" but "what does it refuse, and does the refusal say
 * anything it should not".
 *
 * ⚠️ The tenancy section INSERTS a restriction so there is something to test —
 * this install has an empty analyst_tenant_access, meaning nobody is limited.
 * It runs inside a transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back, so nothing survives
 * the run. Nothing here is committed, ever.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/record-preview-security.php
