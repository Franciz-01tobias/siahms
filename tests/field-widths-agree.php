 *
 * The failure would be quiet. Add a width to the builder and not the service,

/* ---- The GRID CONTAINER, which is what makes a width mean anything ---------
   🔴 WHY THIS SECTION WAS ADDED (#1841). Guarding the width LIST turned out to
   guard only half the mechanism. Every surface emits `data-width="6"` from the
   shared walk in FormRender — but twelfths do nothing unless the element's
   PARENT is the 12-column grid, and the portal's <form> carried
   `class="cat-form-table"`, a class defined in no stylesheet in the repository.
   Its real grid, `.cat-form-grid`, sat in self-service.css fully written and
   referenced by nothing. So every width was calculated, written into the markup
   and silently dropped, and the portal drew as one long column while the
   analyst filler laid the same form out in two.

   Nothing could catch it: an unrecognised class is not an error in CSS, and the
   markup contained no mistake a reader would see. The guard has to assert the
   two halves MEET — that the class the page emits is the class the stylesheet
   defines, and that it carries a rule for every width that may be saved. */
/* 🔴 A class is a WHOLE TOKEN. Matching `\bcat-form-grid\b` inside class="..."
   looks right and is not: a hyphen is a regex word boundary, so the pattern
   also matches `x-cat-form-grid`, which CSS would never style. Compared exactly,
   the way the browser does. Same correction as tests/form-class-collisions.php,
   which cried wolf over `.cat-form-grid` for precisely this reason. */
