/**
 * No endpoint may change data on a GET.
 *
 *   php tests/get-must-not-write.php
 *
 * 🔴 Reported privately, October 2026. includes/csrf.php checks the token and the
 * origin on POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE, and said in its own header that GET "must
 * not change anything" - but nothing made that true. The session cookie is
 * SameSite=Lax, which browsers DO send on a top-level GET from another site, so a
 * link on any web page could make whoever clicked it:
 *   - permanently empty their company's ticket trash (api/tickets/empty_trash.php);
 *   - run Database Verification, or delete a ticket through debug tool D002;
 *   - switch module permissions from "least" to "most", blank the branding, wipe
 *     the SLA settings, clear the public base URL - endpoints that read only a JSON
 *     body, where a link sends no body, every field falls back to its default, and
 *     the defaults passed validation and were saved.
 * About twenty endpoints in all. The fix is one rule: an endpoint that writes calls
 * csrfRequireWriteMethod() before it writes. This test is the rule's enforcement.
 *
 * Checks, in order:
 *   1. the scanner itself, against small fixtures - including a check that only
 *      appears in a comment, and SQL that only appears in a comment;
 *   2. every PHP file under api/ that contains write SQL;
 *   3. that every entry on the allow-list below is still a real file, still
 *      writes, and still has no check (a stale entry is an exemption nobody needs).
 *
 * Reads files only: no database, no web server.
 *
 * TRAP: "it writes" is decided by SQL in the file itself. An endpoint that writes
 *   only through an include function (no SQL of its own) is not seen here - give
 *   it the check anyway.
 *
 * TRAP: a file that reads $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] passes, because this cannot
 *   tell a check that guards the writes from one that does not. Those 51 files were
 *   read by hand in October 2026, and one was wrong: knowledge/permission_model.php
 *   sent ?action=set on a GET straight to the save. In a file that routes on the
 *   method, put csrfRequireWriteMethod() in each write branch.
