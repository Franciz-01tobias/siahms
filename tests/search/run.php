/**
 * The search function — query translation, scope enforcement, result shape.
 *
 * Search has a failure mode that ordinary features do not: it can be WRONG and
 * look RIGHT. A permission filter that quietly does nothing returns a page full
 * of plausible results. A query that matches nothing looks identical to a
 * genuine "not in your tickets". So almost every assertion here is paired with a
 * control proving the check could have failed.
 *
 * Three things it pins:
 *
 *  1. QUERY TRANSLATION. What a person types is not what MySQL is asked. Terms
 *     too short to be indexed must be DROPPED, because requiring one in boolean
 *     mode makes the whole query match nothing — the difference between "search
 *     works" and "search mysteriously returns nothing for that phrase".
 *
 *  2. SCOPE GOES INTO THE QUERY. Every "it was excluded" assertion has a twin
 *     showing the same row IS returned once the predicate is relaxed. Without
 *     that twin, a filter that matched nothing at all would pass.
 *
 *  3. THE RESULT SHAPE. Hits collapse to their ticket and report which parts
 *     matched, because a user thinks in tickets and one ticket with the term in
 *     four replies must not flood the page.
 *
 *   php tests/search/run.php
 *
 * ⚠️ Writes a handful of rows with a reserved source_type and deletes them in a
 * finally block. It cannot use a rolled-back transaction: InnoDB does not expose
 * uncommitted rows to MATCH...AGAINST.
