/**
 * Asset locations: which ones a company can see, including SHARED ones (2.6.0).
 *
 * Locations were purely per-company on purpose: a client's sites are its own.
 * A customer asked for locations shared across companies, such as a data centre
 * or head office that several clients' kit sits in. So a location can now be
 * marked shared, and every company can pick it, alongside its own private ones.
 *
 * THE RULES, and why:
 *
 *  - A shared location is stored with tenant_id NULL and is_shared = 1. NULL
 *    because it belongs to no one company: a company-owned shared location would
 *    vanish from every client the day its owner was deleted (the tenant FK
 *    cascades). The REST API and the importer already treat NULL-tenant
 *    locations as available to everyone, so this matches them.
 *
 *  - A shared location's PARENT must be shared too (or it has none). Otherwise
 *    another company would see a child whose parent it cannot see, and the tree
 *    would draw an orphan.
 *
 *  - Only an analyst who can reach EVERY company may create, change or delete a
 *    shared location. Editing one changes what every client sees, and deleting
 *    one clears it from every client's assets.
 *
 * 🔑 Every guard checks the COLUMN first: `is_shared` does not exist until
 * Database Verification has run, and the asset screen must keep working on an
 * install that has pulled the update but not run it yet.
