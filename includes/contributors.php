/**
 * People who have made a substantial contribution to FreeITSM.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔑 THIS IS A CODE FILE ON PURPOSE, NOT A DATABASE TABLE.
 *
 * A table would need a migration, a schema entry, an admin screen to edit it,
 * and permissions deciding who may — all so that a list which grows a handful
 * of times a year can be changed without a deploy. It is also not an
 * operator's data: it is part of what FreeITSM *is*, and it should read the
 * same on every install rather than being something each site curates.
 *
 * So: add a person here, commit it, and it ships with the next release.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each entry:
 *   name     how they asked to be credited — use exactly what they gave you
 *   github   username without the @, or null if they would rather not be linked
 *   date     the contribution, YYYY-MM-DD. Displayed as a month and year.
 *   what     two or three sentences. Say what they actually did and why it
 *            mattered; "helped with the project" credits nobody.
 *
 * ⚠️ Ask before adding someone. A person's name and GitHub handle on a public
 * product page is their decision, not ours — Sandy was asked in #138 and chose
 * how he wanted to be credited.
 *
 * Newest first.
