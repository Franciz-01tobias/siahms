/**
 * What each ticket row in the inbox middle pane shows, and how.
 *
 * ── Why this is a setting rather than a decision ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * GitHub discussion #61 asked for two things: the assigned agent on the row, and
 * a coloured priority indicator. The request was to REPLACE the description
 * preview with "Assigned to: …", which is the one thing not done here — that line
 * is the only content signal in the row, and it is how you tell "printer jammed
 * again" from something that needs reading now.
 *
 * Everything else is offered rather than chosen, because row density is genuinely
 * personal: a manager scanning a queue for breaches wants different chips from
 * somebody working one department all day. Hence per-analyst, over an install
 * default an administrator sets for everyone who has not chosen.
 *
 * ── The one real design constraint ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ROW ALREADY HAS A COLOURED DOT, AND IT ALREADY MEANS SOMETHING.
 * `.email-sla-pill` carries an SLA dot in red / amber / green. Priority in a
 * traffic-light palette is the obvious second dot and would be actively harmful:
 * red would mean "about to breach" in one place and "Critical" in another, in the
 * same row, and those call for different actions.
 *
 * That is why STRIPE and BLOCK exist as styles at all, and why the shipped
 * default puts priority on the left edge rather than in the footer. Anyone who
 * prefers a dot can still choose one — they just have to choose it.
 */

/**
 * The registry: every field that can appear on a row, and the styles it accepts.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A WHITELIST, NOT DOCUMENTATION. Style values reach the browser as
 * CSS class-name fragments, so an unvalidated value is markup injection. Nothing
 * renders unless it appears here — see inboxDisplayNormalise().
 *
 * Adding a fourth field (department, ticket type, company) is a change to this
 * array plus a column in the list query. It was kept to three because that is
 * what was asked for; the shape is deliberately open.

        // field from its default.
