/**
 * RBAC Layer 2 — per-module SETTINGS permissions.
 *
 * Layer 1 (includes/functions.php: requireModuleAccess) decides which modules an
 * analyst can ENTER. This file is Layer 2: once in a module, may they also
 * ADMINISTER its settings? See docs/design/rbac.md for the full design.
 *
 * Three rules, all enforced here:
 *   - DENY BY DEFAULT. No grant → no settings access. (Opposite of Layer 1's
 *     "absence = everything", and the right default for an admin surface.)
 *   - is_admin BYPASSES the whole layer. A System administrator implicitly holds
 *     every capability, which is what makes deny-by-default safe on upgrade —
 *     the instance owner keeps everything, and the tightening only bites
 *     non-admins (who mostly shouldn't be in settings anyway).
 *   - ENFORCED SERVER-SIDE, page AND api, failing closed — Layer 1's mistake was
 *     hiding cards without enforcing, so a "restricted" analyst could type the URL.
 *
 * A capability key is '<module>.<action>' and MUST appear in rbacCapabilities()
 * below. The DB never stores a capability the code doesn't know: the registry is
 * the source of truth, the tables only reference it.
 */

/**
 * The registry (WHAT capabilities exist) lives in includes/capabilities.php. This file
 * is only concerned with WHO holds them, and with enforcing that.
 *
 * Always pass a Cap:: constant to the functions below, never a string literal — see the
 * header of capabilities.php for why a mistyped string here is the dangerous kind of bug.
 */

/**
 * Every capability an analyst effectively holds, as a flat list of keys.
 *
 * is_admin short-circuits to ALL declared capabilities. Otherwise it's the union of the
 * capabilities granted by the roles assigned to the analyst directly and by the roles
 * assigned to any team they belong to — one query, one choke-point, the same
 * individual-plus-team-unioned shape as module and company access.
 *
 * Two filters are then applied, and the order matters:
 *   1. capFromKey() drops anything the code no longer defines (and maps retired keys
 *      through capAliases()), so a stale or hand-inserted DB row can never grant.
 *   2. capExpandUmbrellas() adds everything an umbrella grant implies, so holding
 *      '<module>.manage' gives you the module's individual capabilities too.
