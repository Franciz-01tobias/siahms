/**
 * IssueTrackerProvider — the provider-agnostic contract for an external issue
 * tracker (Jira first; GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps behind the same door).
 *
 * Everything above this line — the link registry, the outbound queue, the
 * inbound event pipeline, echo suppression, the workflow action, the settings
 * and ticket UI — talks to this interface and never knows which tracker is live.
 * That is the same split as includes/messaging/MessagingProvider.php, which
 * already puts Twilio and Meta Cloud behind one contract, and it is deliberately
 * copied rather than reinvented.
 *
 * Concrete providers are constructed with a DECRYPTED integration_connections
 * row (credentials already a PHP array).
 *
 * ── Conventions, both borrowed from MessagingProvider ────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. Only the genuinely universal methods are abstract. Optional ones default
 *     to throwing "not supported for this provider", so the contract never
 *     collapses to a lowest common denominator just because one tracker lacks a
 *     concept.
 *
 *  2. supports() answers the same question for the UI. A thrown exception is the
 *     wrong way for a settings screen to discover that GitHub has no issue
 *     types — it needs to know BEFORE it renders the field.
 *
 * ── The canonical event shape (what normaliseEvent/pollChanges return) ───────
 *
 *   [
 *     'event_id'   => 'jira-evt-8837',   // provider's id, for dedupe; required
 *     'type'       => 'status_changed',  // status_changed | comment_added |
 *                                        // issue_created | field_changed
 *     'external_id'=> '10042',           // the issue this is about
 *     'status_name'     => 'In Progress',       // status_changed only
 *     'status_category' => 'in_progress',       // status_changed only; see below
 *     'comment_id'      => '10101',             // comment_added only
 *     'comment_body'    => 'Need repro steps',  // comment_added only
 *     'author_identity' => 'svc@acme.com',      // WHO did it — drives echo suppression
 *     'occurred_at'     => 1785600000,          // unix seconds, or null
 *   ]
 *
 * ⚠️ status_category is one of the four STATUS_* constants and nothing else.
 * Every decision in the system keys off it; status_name is for display only.
 * Jira statuses are per-project and freely renamed, so branching on the name is
 * the same mistake as keying a rule on a ticket status name — see the comment on
 * tickets.merged_into_id for the last time that bit us.
