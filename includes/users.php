 * Of those, the ones a person may change about THEMSELVES in the self-service

 * service desk?" — their own telephone number, obviously; their own job title
 * after a promotion, reasonably; where they sit, usefully, because the ticket
 * asset picker searches on location and nobody fills that in by hand.
 *
 * 🔴 THE THREE THAT ARE ABSENT MATTER MORE THAN THE FOUR THAT ARE HERE:
 *
 *  - `manager_id` — a requester must never choose their own approver. Nothing
 *    routes along the chain TODAY (`includes/catalogue_approvals.php` sends
 *    catalogue approvals to a designated analyst and calls manager-based
 *    routing "a later slice"), so this is not a live hole. It becomes one the
 *    day that slice lands, and by then a portal full of self-chosen managers
 *    would already be in place. Excluded now, while it costs nothing.
 *  - `employee_id` — a payroll number is an identity claim, not a contact
 *    detail. It is the join key when reconciling against HR, so a person
 *    typing their own would be asserting who they are in another system.
 *  - `department` — an organisational fact the service desk maintains, not
 *    something about the person. `idx_users_department` exists and the asset
 *    search reads it, so self-service reorganisation is somebody else's data
 *    changing under them.
 *
 * ⚠️ A field being in this list still does NOT mean it is editable: a record
 * flagged `is_managed` refuses all of USER_DIRECTORY_OWNED, and every one of
 * these is in that list too. The directory stays the source of truth; this list
 * only governs what an UNMANAGED person may do for themselves.
