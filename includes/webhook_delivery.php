 * Outbound webhook delivery — shared between the workflow engine (which

 *
 * The `send_webhook` workflow action builds the request (URL, headers incl. any
 * HMAC signature, rendered JSON body) and calls webhookEnqueue() — returning
 * instantly, so a slow or dead endpoint never blocks the host request. The
 * worker (cron/webhook_deliveries.php) later picks up due rows and calls
 * webhookRunQueue(), which delivers each with retries and exponential backoff,
 * dead-lettering after max_attempts. Every outcome is recorded on the row, so
 * the delivery log is the single source of truth for what was sent and when.

//  post into that channel) and the signing secret is a true secret — its whole
//  job is proving a message genuinely came from us, which a reader of the
//  database could otherwise forge. Both are therefore encrypted at rest, in
//  workflows.actions AND in webhook_deliveries.url.
//
//  BEST-EFFORT BY DESIGN. The encryption key is a file an admin creates; not
//  every install has one. If encryptValue() throws because the key is missing,
//  we store the value as we always did rather than break webhooks outright —
//  and System > Webhooks says so plainly instead of implying protection that
//  isn't there. decryptValue() already passes non-"ENC:" values through
//  untouched, so plaintext rows written before this change keep working and get
//  encrypted the next time they're saved. No backfill, no migration window.

//  Payload retention
//
//  webhook_deliveries.request_body holds the FULL rendered payload — and with
//  the Full-record preset that is an entire ticket (subject, requester, the
//  lot), copied in plaintext into a second table and kept forever. That is a
//  bigger data-at-rest question than the URL ever was, so it gets an explicit,
//  admin-visible answer rather than an accidental one.
//
//  This is DISTINCT from the pre-existing `webhook_delivery_retention_days`
//  (default 30), which deletes the whole ROW. This one blanks just the BODIES
//  and keeps the row, so it can run on a SHORTER clock: the sensitive payload
//  goes early, while the delivery record (status, timing, endpoint, error) —
//  the part you actually need for an audit — survives to the row's own horizon.
//  Defaults to 7 days on that reasoning. Replay is a "something just broke"
//  tool used within hours, not weeks.
//
//  The purge BLANKS the bodies but KEEPS the rows, so the dashboard's
//  success-rate / volume / timing stats survive intact. The trade-off: Replay
//  needs the body, so a purged delivery can no longer be replayed — the replay
//  endpoint says so rather than silently POSTing an EMPTY payload to a live
//  endpoint, which would be far worse than refusing.
