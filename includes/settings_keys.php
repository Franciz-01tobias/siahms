/**
 * Who owns each key in `system_settings`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * api/settings/save_system_settings.php is a GENERIC key/value writer: it loops over
 * whatever keys the caller posts and writes them. Five settings pages use it —
 * Asset Management (warranty/vCenter/Intune), Tickets (general), and the System
 * colours/security/SSO areas — because those tabs have no endpoint of their own.
 *
 * That made it impossible to authorise properly. A guard at the top of the file is
 * meaningless when it's the same file for all five callers, so the endpoint checked
 * only that you were a logged-in analyst. Any analyst — including one whose module
 * access was a single unrelated module — could therefore POST any key and overwrite
 * any system setting: vCenter and Intune credentials, the SSO configuration, or the
 * brute-force lockout policy (max_failed_logins, lockout_duration_minutes).
 *
 * So the capability attaches to the KEY, not the file. This map is the authority:
 * save_system_settings.php looks up each posted key and demands its owner's access.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DENY BY DEFAULT, AND FAIL LOUD
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A key that is NOT in this map is REJECTED. That matters twice over:
 *
 *  1. `system_settings` holds ~88 keys, but only the ones below are legitimately
 *     written through this endpoint. The rest — branding, AI provider keys, cron
 *     tokens, module_permission_mode, local_login_enabled — have their own dedicated,
 *     guarded endpoints. There is no reason for a generic writer to reach them, and
 *     before this map, it could.
 *
 *  2. If a key is missed when a new tab is built, the symptom is that saving that tab
 *     ERRORS VISIBLY. The alternative failure — silently accepting an unowned key —
 *     is how this hole existed in the first place. Loud beats open.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ROLLOUT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 'cap' is the per-tab capability that will own the key once its module is converted
 * (docs/design/rbac.md §9, phase 3b). Until then it is null and the key falls back to
 * 'module' — plain Layer 1 module access, which is exactly what reaching these settings
 * pages requires today, so nothing breaks. When a module converts, fill in its 'cap'.
 *
 * Module 'system' resolves to is_admin via analystCanAccessModule(), so the System
 * areas are admin-only with no special-casing here.
 */

 * Exact key -> owner. 'tab' is documentation: it names the settings tab the key
