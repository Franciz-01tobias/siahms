/**
 * Asset expiry dates → Calendar sync.
 *
 * Keeps two sets of auto-generated, all-day calendar events in step with the
 * dates on an asset:
 *
 *   warranty_expiry → "Warranty expiry: HOST", source 'asset_warranty'
 *   lease_expiry    → "Lease ends: HOST",      source 'asset_lease'
 *
 * Each is gated by its own setting (asset_warranty_surface / asset_lease_surface)
 * and cleared and rebuilt on its own `source`, so a full resync never disturbs
 * user-created events, and switching one kind off never removes the other.
 *
 * The file is still named after warranty because warranty is what it did first
 * and the name is referenced from several call sites; what it covers is the
 * list above, not the filename.
 *
 * Called opportunistically when an asset's warranty or lease date changes
 * (update_asset_field.php) and on demand when either setting is saved
 * (sync_warranty_calendar.php). Cheap full resync — these edits are rare and the
 * event set is small.
