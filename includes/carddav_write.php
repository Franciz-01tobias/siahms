/**
 * CardDAV write-back — editing a contact card without rewriting it.
 *
 * Asked for in https://github.com/edmozley/freeitsm/issues/133, where the
 * reporter's argument is that a telephone number changes DURING the phone call,
 * and having to then correct it in a second application is exactly what an ITSM
 * tool should stop you doing.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴🔴 WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM includes/carddav.php.
 *
 * The import is provably read-only: it issues `PROPFIND` and `REPORT` and
 * nothing else, which is the honest answer when an operator asks whether
 * connecting FreeITSM can damage their address book. `PUT` lives here, in a file
 * the import path never loads, so that guarantee stays a fact about the code
 * rather than a promise about intentions.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 🔴🔴 AND THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING BELOW: NEVER GENERATE A VCARD.
 *
 * The obvious implementation is to take the seven person fields, render a vCard
 * and PUT it. That silently destroys everything on the card FreeITSM does not
 * model — the photo, the birthday, the notes, the street and postcode (only the
 * town is imported), every `X-` property somebody's CRM writes, and the
 * `CATEGORIES` line that decides whether the card is even in scope on the next
 * run. It would look like it worked. The operator would discover it months
 * later, with no way back.
 *
 * So this edits the bytes the server gave us. A property whose value changed has
 * its line rewritten in place; every other line, understood or not, is passed
 * through untouched. That also disposes of the vCard 3.0 versus 4.0 question,
 * which otherwise needs a policy: the card keeps whatever `VERSION` it already
 * declares, because nothing rewrites it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The safety here is deliberately ASYMMETRIC with the import. A bad import
 * damages OUR data and can be re-imported. A bad write-back damages the
 * operator's address book and cannot be undone by us at all. So write-back
 * touches only fields FreeITSM owns, only on cards it imported, and only when a
 * human deliberately edited one — there is no bulk reconciliation pass, and
 * there should never be one.

/**
 * Write a card back, refusing if it has changed on the server since we read it.
 *
 * 🔴🔴 `If-Match` IS THE WHOLE SAFETY MODEL AND IS NOT OPTIONAL. Without it a
 * `PUT` is last-writer-wins: an analyst edits a phone number, and in doing so
 * silently reverts the address the customer's own office updated an hour ago in
 * Outlook, because our copy of the card was fetched last night. With it, the
 * server compares ETags and answers 412 — and 412 is not a failure, it is the
 * feature. It means "somebody else got there first", and the honest response is
 * to re-read the card and apply the change to the current version.
 *
 * ⚠️ An EMPTY etag is refused outright rather than sent as `If-Match: *`, which
 * means "any existing card" and would be exactly the unguarded overwrite this
 * exists to prevent. No stored ETag means we have not really read this card, and
 * the correct move is to fetch it, not to write over it.

 * Push a person's changed fields to their card in the address book.

 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴🔴 THE CONCURRENCY DESIGN, WHICH IS THE HARD PART AND NOT OBVIOUS.
 *
 * There are three plausible schemes and two of them are wrong.
 *
 *   WRONG 1 — PUT with the ETag stored at import time. Safe, but it refuses
 *   whenever ANY field on the card changed since the last sync, including ones
 *   FreeITSM does not even read. An analyst correcting a phone number would be
 *   blocked because somebody added a birthday last week.
 *
 *   WRONG 2 — GET the card, edit it, PUT with the ETag that GET just returned.
 *   This never refuses anything, which sounds convenient and in fact means the
 *   concurrency guard has been switched off: `If-Match` can no longer fail,
 *   because we just asked the server which value would make it pass.
 *
 *   WHAT THIS DOES — GET the card fresh, and before editing, compare the
 *   server's CURRENT value of each field being written against the value
 *   FreeITSM held before this save. If they differ, somebody else changed that
 *   same field, and the write is refused as a real conflict. If they match, the
 *   edit is applied to the fresh bytes so everybody else's changes to other
 *   properties survive, and the PUT carries the fresh ETag purely to close the
 *   few milliseconds between the GET and the PUT.
 *
 * That is a per-field three-way merge, and it is the only one of the three that
 * both preserves other people's work and notices when two people changed the
 * same thing.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 🔴 THIS NEVER FAILS THE CALLER'S SAVE. FreeITSM's own record has already been
 * written by the time this runs, and rolling it back because somebody else's
 * server is unreachable would throw away the analyst's work to report a problem
 * they cannot do anything about. Every outcome is returned for the UI to
 * mention, and none of them is an exception.
 *
 * @param array $changes  field => the value just saved
 * @param array $previous field => the value FreeITSM held BEFORE this save
 *
 * @return array ['attempted'=>bool, 'ok'=>bool, 'changed'=>string[],
 *                'conflict'=>bool, 'error'=>string, 'reason'=>string]
 *               `reason` explains an attempted=false, which is the ordinary case
 *               for every person who is not a CardDAV contact.
