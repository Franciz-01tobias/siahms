/**
 * Shared parser + drift self-check for the index backfill list.
 *
 * `database/freeitsm.sql` is the source of truth for the schema;
 * `includes/db_verify_indexes.php` is a GENERATED mirror of its indexes that
 * Database Verification uses to restore missing ones. The risk is the classic
 * one: someone adds an index to freeitsm.sql and forgets to regenerate, so the
 * mirror goes stale and grown installs silently miss the new index — the very
 * drift the backfill was built to end.
 *
 * These two functions close that loop. ONE parser produces the list (via
 * scripts/gen_db_verify_indexes.php) and audits it (via the self-check that
 * db_verify runs on every pass), so the generator and the checker can never
 * disagree. Mirrors the capSelfCheck() / settings-manifest self-check pattern.

 * Extract every named secondary index from freeitsm.sql text:

 * 2026-08; full-text search needs a third kind, and a two-valued flag had
 * nowhere to put it. dbVerifyIndexTypeOf() below reads either shape, so a
 * generated list from before the change still audits and applies correctly
 * rather than silently becoming the wrong kind of index.
