/**
 * Ticket numbering — the ONE place a ticket number is made or recognised.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `generateTicketNumber()` was written THREE times —
 * in includes/services/tickets.php, api/self-service/create_ticket.php and
 * api/tickets/check_mailbox_email.php — and the format was hardcoded a fourth,
 * fifth, sixth and seventh time as the regex `[A-Z]{3}-\d{3}-\d{5}` across four
 * more files. A setting that reached only one of them would have given portal
 * tickets one format and emailed tickets another.
 *
 * 🔴 THE LANDMINE THIS FILE DEFUSES. Every notification FreeITSM has ever sent
 * carries `[SDREF:CKQ-418-73926]` in its subject, and those emails live in
 * customers' inboxes forever. The inbound parser used to look for that exact
 * SHAPE. Change the format and every reply to every historical email silently
 * becomes a new ticket — no error, no warning, across the whole estate at once.
 * Zammad's own documentation carries the same warning about its numbering.
 *
 * 🔑 The fix is a change of principle: **the tag is a delimiter, the DATABASE is
 * the authority.** Capture whatever sits between `SDREF:` and `]`, then look it
 * up. The parser must never encode a format, because there is no longer only
 * one — an install can change format, and every number it ever issued has to go
 * on working.
