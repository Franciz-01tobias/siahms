/**
 * CMDB impact analysis — the ONE implementation of "what breaks if this breaks".
 *
 * Lives in includes/ rather than api/cmdb/ because the internal endpoint
 * (api/cmdb/get_object_impact.php) and the public REST API
 * (api/v1/resources/cmdb.php) both need it. Before this file they each carried
 * their own copy of the descendants walk.
 *
 * Two things are computed, and they answer different questions:
 *
 *   cmdbDirectImpact()  — what is attached to this object right now, one hop out,
 *                         split into the three buckets the UI and the REST API
 *                         have always returned. Shape is frozen: /cmdb/objects/
 *                         {id}/impact is a published contract.
 *
 *   cmdbBlastRadius()   — what would ultimately be affected if this object
 *                         failed, following impact-bearing edges as far as they
 *                         go. This is the transitive view: a server takes out a
 *                         VM, which takes out an application, which takes out a
 *                         customer-facing service.
 *
 * WHICH EDGES CARRY IMPACT
 * ------------------------
 * Not every link means "a failure travels this way", and the ones that do don't
 * all point the same way. Following every edge blindly would report that a
 * server failure affects the building it is located in.
 *
 *   Containment (parent_id)  — always carries impact. Parent semantics in this
 *                              module are ontological dependency (the FK
 *                              cascade-deletes), so if the parent is gone the
 *                              children are gone. Direction: parent -> child.
 *
 *   Relationships            — only when the *type* says so, via
 *                              cmdb_relationship_types.impact_direction:
 *                                'none'    ignore it ("is located in")
 *                                'to_from' the TO object failing affects the
 *                                          FROM object ("A depends on B")
 *                                'from_to' the FROM object failing affects the
 *                                          TO object ("A hosts B")
 *
 *   object_ref properties    — only when cmdb_class_properties.spreads_impact
 *                              is set. A dependency recorded as a field rather
 *                              than a relationship, e.g. a Database whose
 *                              "Host Server" points at a Server. Direction is
 *                              always referenced -> holder.
 *
 * Everything defaults to "does not spread", so an upgraded install reports
 * exactly what it did before until someone deliberately configures it.
 *
 * MULTI-COMPANY
 * -------------
 * A CI belongs to exactly one company and the model forbids cross-company
 * links (see the CMDB wiki page). The walk still filters by the root's company
 * rather than trusting that invariant — one bad row predating the rule would
 * otherwise let a blast radius enumerate another company's estate, and the
 * caller has already authorised the root only. NULL tenant_id means the default
 * company's, so it is resolved before comparing.
 */

// Required, not guarded with function_exists(). The company filter below is a
// security rule: if these helpers were merely assumed-present and weren't, the
// guard would fail open and the walk would cross companies silently.
