/**
 * Central SSL/TLS policy for outbound HTTPS.
 *
 * Every outbound cURL handle in the app routes its certificate-verification
 * setup through sslApplyCurl(). That gives us a single global switch
 * (SSL_VERIFY_PEER, in config.php) instead of the per-module "Verify SSL"
 * tick-boxes we used to scatter across settings pages — which were confusing
 * (some ANDed with the global, some independent) and, worse, let the UI imply
 * a security state the server couldn't actually deliver.
 *
 * Why CURLOPT_CAINFO rather than php.ini or an env var:
 *   On a stock Windows/WAMP install, Apache's php.ini has no `curl.cainfo`, so
 *   verification fails with "unable to get local issuer certificate". You can't
 *   fix that from PHP at runtime — `curl.cainfo` is PHP_INI_SYSTEM (ini_set has
 *   no effect) and this libcurl build ignores the CURL_CA_BUNDLE env var. The
 *   only mechanism that works without hand-editing php.ini is setting the bundle
 *   per-handle with CURLOPT_CAINFO, which is what we ship a cacert.pem for.
 *
 * WHY BOTH DEFINITIONS ARE GUARDED BY function_exists(), same as includes/db.php:
 * every caller loads config.php first, and config.php requires this file. An
 * operator whose own config.php carries a hand-pasted copy of either function
 * would otherwise trade "undefined function" for "cannot redeclare" - the same
 * outage in the other direction. Theirs wins; this fills the hole for everyone
 * else. See GH #129.
 *
 * AND WHY EVERY DIRECTLY-REQUESTABLE ENTRY POINT MUST REQUIRE THIS FILE ITSELF:
 * reaching sslApplyCurl() only through config.php means the operator's file is
 * load-bearing, which is exactly what #129 forbids. Most callers arrive via
 * includes/functions.php, which requires this file; the OAuth callbacks
 * deliberately do not load functions.php, so they require it directly.
 * tests/config-not-load-bearing.php enforces that structurally.

 * Resolve a CA bundle path for CURLOPT_CAINFO, or '' to leave cURL on its

 * Priority:
 *   1. A bundle an admin (or the OS) already configured in php.ini — honour it.
 *   2. On Windows only, the cacert.pem we ship, since PHP-on-Windows has none.
 *   3. Otherwise '' — on Linux with no configured bundle, cURL's system trust
 *      store is correct and we must not override it with a possibly-staler copy.
