/**
 * Watchtower settings — which cards appear, and which statuses feed each count.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A FLAG ON THE STATUS ROW
 *
 * A status carries facts about itself — is_closed, is_default, pauses_sla — and
 * the SLA engine and half the application depend on them. "Show this one on my
 * dashboard" is not a fact about the status, it is a fact about the dashboard,
 * and it differs per site: one team treats Blocked as the first thing they want
 * to see in the morning, another never looks at it. Putting it on the status
 * would also mean tuning Watchtower by touring three modules' settings screens —
 * which is already the situation for the two Watchtower settings that exist
 * (one lives in Assets, and one has no screen at all).
 *
 * THE DEFAULT MUST BE CORRECT WITHOUT ANYONE CONFIGURING ANYTHING
 *
 * No row here means "use the built-in behaviour", which is the general,
 * name-free version. So a fresh install, and every existing one, is right on
 * day one and this screen only ever TRIMS what is already true. If ticking
 * boxes were what made Watchtower correct, every install would be wrong until
 * somebody found the screen — and a blank dashboard reads as "nothing needs
 * attention", which is the most dangerous thing it could say.
 *
 * is_customised is what makes that work: it separates "not configured" from
 * "configured to show nothing". Without it an empty selection is
 * indistinguishable from an untouched one, and would silently mean "all".
