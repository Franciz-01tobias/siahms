/**
 * CalendarSyncProvider — the provider-agnostic contract for putting an analyst's
 * scheduled work into the calendar they actually live in (GH discussion #75).
 *
 * Everything above this line — which tickets sync, whose, what happens when one
 * is reassigned or unscheduled, the remote-id map, the per-analyst enrolment and
 * the settings UI — talks to this interface and never knows which calendar is
 * live. That is the same split as includes/integrations/IssueTrackerProvider.php
 * and includes/messaging/MessagingProvider.php, and it is deliberately copied
 * rather than reinvented.
 *
 * 🔑 THE REASON THIS IS AN INTERFACE AND NOT JUST GRAPH CODE. What varies
 * between providers is genuinely small: create, update and delete an event in a
 * named person's calendar. Everything difficult here — deciding whose calendar,
 * removing the old copy when a ticket moves from A to B, not orphaning events
 * when somebody opts out — is provider-independent. So keeping the door open for
 * Google (or CalDAV, or nothing at all) costs almost nothing, while a
 * Microsoft-shaped hole would have to be dug out again later.
 *
 * ⚠️ Not every install can use ANY of these. A shop with no supported provider
 * falls back to a subscribe (.ics) link, which needs no provider code at all —
 * so "we have not implemented your calendar" must never mean "you get nothing".
 *
 * Concrete providers are constructed with a DECRYPTED calendar_connections row
 * (credentials already a PHP array), exactly as IssueTrackerProvider is.
 *
 * ── The canonical event shape (what push() is given) ────────────────────────
 *
 *   [
 *     'subject'   => 'TICKET-000105 — Rebuild laptop',   // required
 *     'body'      => 'Requester: …\nStatus: …',          // plain text, may be ''
 *     'start'     => '2026-09-01 14:00:00',   // NAIVE wall clock — see below
 *     'end'       => '2026-09-01 16:00:00',
 *     'all_day'   => false,
 *     'timezone'  => 'Europe/London',         // the zone the naive values mean
 *     'url'       => 'https://…/tickets/?ticket_id=635',  // link back
 *   ]
 *
 * ⚠️ START AND END ARE NAIVE WALL-CLOCK, not UTC. Scheduling values in FreeITSM
 * are stored without a zone on purpose — "2pm" means 2pm to every analyst (see
 * assets/js/schedule.js). A provider MUST combine them with 'timezone' rather
 * than assuming UTC, or every event lands an hour out for half the year. This is
 * the single most likely way to get this integration subtly wrong.
