/**
 * What the self-service portal shows about service status (discussion #99).
 *
 * The requester asked for internal and external comments on incidents, with the
 * external ones visible to end users. Worth being clear about what changed:
 * before this, updates were not "all treated the same" so much as ALL INTERNAL,
 * because the portal never showed any of them. It showed a service and a
 * colour. So this is mostly about starting to communicate, not about splitting
 * something that was already public.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY portal-facing read goes through here. There is exactly one query
 * that decides what an end user may see, and it is the one below.
 *
 * 🔴 OFF BY DEFAULT, and that is not timidity. Turning it on publishes incident
 * TITLES, which were written when nobody expected a customer to read them — an
 * upgrade that started showing "Exchange DAG failover borked again" on the
 * portal would be doing something no upgrade should be able to do. An
 * administrator turns it on under System once they have looked.
