/**
 * ChecklistsService — the single home for the SOP-checklist rules that other
 * modules have to obey.
 *
 * Contributed as PR #141 by Santhosh Srinivasan; this layer was added during
 * integration so the one rule that reaches outside the module — "a ticket with
 * outstanding mandatory steps does not close" — is written once instead of
 * being re-stated by every caller that can close a ticket.
 *
 * Follows the three service rules (wiki: Service-Layer-Architecture):
 *   1. method(PDO, ActorContext, …) — no superglobals
 *   2. no transport — returns data or throws ServiceError, never echoes
 *   3. typed errors — ServiceError(kind, code, message)
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔴 WHY THE GATE IS HERE AND NOT IN THE BROWSER
 *
 * As contributed, the gate was an alert() in assets/js/inbox.js and nothing
 * else. The UI refused to close the ticket; the v1 REST API, bulk actions, the
 * workflow engine and one line of curl all closed it with every mandatory step
 * outstanding. For a feature whose entire purpose is ISO/SOP compliance, an
 * unenforced gate is worse than no gate — it reports control that isn't there.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND WHY IT CAN ALWAYS BE OVERRIDDEN.
 *
 * assets/js/inbox.js already carries the house position, written for #83 and
 * sitting three lines below where the checklist gate was inserted:
 *
 *     "closing a ticket that still has unfinished tasks WARNS, it never blocks
 *      … a warning that cannot be shown must not become a block that cannot be
 *      cleared."
 *
 * That is right, and a hard block breaks it: the analyst who owned step 4 has
 * left, the step is obsolete, and the ticket is stuck forever with no way out
 * but SQL. So the rule is not "you cannot close this". It is:
 *
 *     close it with the steps outstanding and the override is RECORDED —
 *     who closed it, when, and which steps were skipped.
 *
 * Which is what a compliance feature should produce anyway. An auditor does not
 * want a system where the bad outcome was impossible; they want one where it is
 * attributable. Blocking hides the exception, recording it surfaces it.

     *   the template   Standard (warn and record) or Critical (block), chosen
     *                  by whoever wrote the procedure, because they are the one

     *                  every template and blocks the lot.

     * There is deliberately no company setting that loosens a Critical template
     * to a warning. An operator who wants that should edit the template, where
     * the change is visible to the people following the procedure.

     * 🔑 Strictest wins, and a ticket carrying several checklists is resolved a
     * checklist at a time by assertClosureAllowed() — so one Critical checklist
     * blocks the close even if three Standard ones would have warned.
