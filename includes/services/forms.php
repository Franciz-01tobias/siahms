/**
 * FormsService — the single home for the forms module's write rules:
 * form save (create + id-based field sync), version fork, delete
 * (leaf/chain), submission create (with the form.submitted workflow dispatch)
 * and submission delete.
 *
 * Shared by the UI endpoints (api/forms/*.php) and the REST API
 * (api/v1/resources/forms.php). Each caller passes an ActorContext + canonical
 * input; this layer validates + writes and returns the affected id(s) or throws
 * ServiceError. It never emits HTTP. The AI form-generation + settings endpoints
 * are UI-only and stay out of here.
 *
 * Canonical behaviour = the API resource's (see docs/design/service-layer.md):
 * an empty field label / unknown field_type is a 422 (the UI silently dropped /
 * blindly stored), an unknown field id in a submission is a 422 (was a raw FK
 * error), a frozen (non-leaf) version can't be edited/forked (409), and delete
 * is leaf-only unless the chain flag is set. Timestamps are written UTC.
 *
 * ⚙️ Side effect: a successful submission dispatches the `form.submitted`
 * workflow event with a label-keyed answers map (+ the first email answer) —
 * the "new starter form → tickets" automation. It fires after commit and its
 * errors are swallowed so a workflow can never break a submission — caught as
 * Throwable, not Exception, because these run after the commit and a PHP Error
 * escaping there would fail a submission that is already saved.

       table cell is cramped past two options — a dropdown says the same thing
