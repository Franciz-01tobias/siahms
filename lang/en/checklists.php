/**
 * Checklists & SOPs — English strings.
 *
 * The module was contributed with its screens hardcoded in English (2.0.0,
 * Santhosh Srinivasan) and this namespace originally covered the help page
 * only. The four screens — the template list, the settings tabs, the template
 * editor and the panel on a ticket — were wired to t() afterwards.
 *
 * 🔴 HOW THE GAP WAS FOUND, because no tool here could find it. Ed opened the
 * Checklists page with Spanish set and saw "Ayuda" in the nav and every other
 * word in English. `i18n_audit.php` reported Spanish at 100% and was right:
 * the strings were not missing from lang/es, they were missing from lang/en
 * as well, because they had never left the PHP. A locale comparison can only
 * see keys that exist.
 *
 * `scripts/i18n_unwired.php` is the check that CAN see it — it counts strings
 * a file renders against the number of t() calls it makes. Run it after adding
 * a screen.
