/**
 * API: store an image for a form's image block.
 * POST multipart: form_id, image
 *
 * 🔒 Every byte goes through uploadStoreFile(), which is the ONE place the
 * upload rules live: an extension AND mime whitelist, a random stored filename
 * drawn from our own list rather than the caller's string, and an .htaccess in
 * the destination that disables execution. None of the three is trusted alone.
 *
 * 🔴 UPLOAD_TYPES_IMAGE, not UPLOAD_TYPES_ATTACHMENT. The default whitelist is
 * the ceiling for a ticket attachment and includes documents and archives; an
 * image block can only ever be an image. Narrower is the right default and the
 * constant is shared, so SVG stays excluded — it is XML, it can carry <script>,
 * and a browser will run it if the file is ever served inline. Branding accepts
 * one because an administrator uploads the logo; nothing a form shows to a
 * customer should.
 *
 * 🔑 Writing is analyst-only: building a form is not something a portal user
 * does. READING is a different and wider question — see image.php.
