/**
 * Who may request a form from the self-service catalogue (GH #145).
 *
 *   GET  ?form_id=N        — the groups that exist, and which are selected
 *   POST {form_id, group_ids} — replace the selection ([] = everyone)
 *
 * 🔑 The groups are PEOPLE groups (Tickets → Users → Groups). They are the only
 * one of the three group concepts in this product that holds portal users as
 * well as analysts, which is exactly why they are the right principal here — a
 * team holds analysts, and analysts do not use the catalogue.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is an ANALYST endpoint. It decides what CUSTOMERS may see, but the
 * deciding is administration, so it is gated on the Forms module like every
 * other form setting. The enforcement lives in the portal's own queries.
