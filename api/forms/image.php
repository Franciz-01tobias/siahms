/**
 * Serve an image block's picture.
 * GET ?field=<form_fields.id>
 *
 * 🔴 IT TAKES A FIELD ID, NOT A PATH. The path is read out of that field's own
 * config, server-side. That removes directory traversal as a CATEGORY rather
 * than filtering for it: there is no caller-supplied string anywhere near the
 * filesystem, so `?path=1/../../config.php` has nothing to attach itself to.
 * The shape of the stored path is re-checked anyway, because a value that came
 * from our own upload endpoint is still a value from a database row.
 *
 * 🔴 WHO MAY SEE IT. Two different answers, and conflating them is how a form
 * that was never published leaks:
 *
 *   an analyst with Forms access   — any form's image
 *   a signed-in portal user        — ONLY a form that is portal-visible, active
 *                                    and the current version
 *
 * Anything else is a 404, never a 403: a refusal that distinguishes "not yours"
 * from "does not exist" tells an unauthenticated person which ids are real.
