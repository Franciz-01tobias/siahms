/**
 * API Endpoint: create an asset from the UI.
 *
 * Until now the ONLY way to create an asset was the inventory agent, Intune,
 * vCenter or POST /api/v1/assets — every one of which assumes the thing reports
 * for itself. A television, a printer or a headset never will, so recording one
 * meant a curl command. This is the front door.
 *
 * Thin adapter over AssetsService::createAsset — the duplicate-hostname refusal,
 * field validation and audit trail all live there, shared with the REST API.
 *
 * Deliberately CORE FIELDS ONLY. Custom fields are filled in on the asset
 * itself, where there is room for them and the "3 of 3 filled in" counter says
 * what is outstanding; a modal is the wrong place to answer eight questions.
