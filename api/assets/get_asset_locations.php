/**
 * API Endpoint: List asset locations (flat) — multi-tenancy aware.
 *
 * Locations are an arbitrary-depth tree (the client builds it from parent_id),
 * and they are PER COMPANY (a client's physical sites are its own), EXCEPT the
 * ones marked shared (2.6.0), which every company sees. So the tree is scoped
 * like the assets themselves: the Default company owns the pre-existing
 * (NULL-tenant) locations, and each client company sees its own plus the shared
 * ones. On a single-company install this is simply every location, as before.
 *
 * Used by both the settings tree and the asset location picker, so scoping here
 * scopes both.
