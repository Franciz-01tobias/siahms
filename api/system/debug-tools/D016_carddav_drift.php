/**
 * Debug Tool D016 — Where do FreeITSM and the address book disagree?
 *
 * A top-to-bottom comparison: every person imported from a CardDAV address book,
 * against the card they came from, field by field.
 *
 * ⭐ THIS IS ALSO THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION NOBODY ANSWERED. #133 asked for
 * two-way sync; the reply asked the reporter which details actually drift, and
 * in which direction, because that is the one piece of evidence that would shape
 * it. No answer came. This measures it instead of asking — and it works on the
 * operator's own data, which is better evidence than anybody's recollection.
 *
 * 🔴 READ-ONLY. It changes nothing on either side, in either direction. It does
 * not write to the address book, it does not update `users`, and it deliberately
 * offers no "fix it" button: deciding which side is right is exactly the
 * judgement a person has to make, and a one-click reconcile over hundreds of
 * contacts is how a careful integration becomes a data-loss incident.
 *
 * ⚠️ It reads the WHOLE address book, so it is slower than the other tools here.
 * That is inherent - there is no way to ask a CardDAV server "which of these
 * changed" without fetching them.
 *
 * Output: plain text, section-delimited with === HEADERS ===.
