/**
 * Debug Tool D006 — SSL / HTTPS certificate verification
 *
 * Answers one question end to end: "can this server actually make a
 * certificate-verified HTTPS request, and if not, why?"
 *
 * FreeITSM makes a lot of outbound HTTPS calls (mailboxes, AI providers, SSO,
 * Intune/vCenter, webhooks, email). Since #919 verification is ON by default
 * (SSL_VERIFY_PEER) and every handle goes through sslApplyCurl(), which attaches
 * a CA bundle. This tool shows the whole chain — the global switch, the php.ini
 * CA config, the shipped includes/cacert.pem, which bundle actually wins, and a
 * batch of LIVE verified requests to the real services the app talks to — so a
 * "certificate problem" is diagnosed in one place instead of guessed at.
 *
 * ⚠️ It also asks the question a live request cannot: config.php is the
 * OPERATOR'S file and never upgrades, so a hand-assembled or pre-release copy can
 * lack the SSL block the app expects. Every certificate test here can pass while a
 * mailbox sign-in still dies on "Call to undefined function sslApplyCurl()".
 * This tool used to print that helper's function_exists() as if it meant something,
 * having itself loaded functions.php first - so it could only ever say YES.
 *
 * READ-ONLY. It makes unauthenticated HEAD requests to public endpoints and
 * writes nothing. Prints no secrets (no API keys, no request bodies).
 *
 * Output: plain text, section-delimited with === HEADERS === for easy skimming.

// helper LOAD it itself rather than relying on that file? See GH #129 and
