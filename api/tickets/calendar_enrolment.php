/**
 * API: an analyst's OWN calendar choice (GH #75, CalDAV #133).
 *
 *   GET            -> my mode, my connection, where my work would go, and what is on offer
 *   POST mode=off|push|feed [connection_id]
 *
 * CalDAV only - the analyst signs in as themselves, so they also choose where:
 *   POST action=caldav_discover  connection_id, username, password -> the calendars that sign-in can write to
 *   POST action=caldav_save      connection_id, username, password, calendar_url[, turn_on=1]
 *   POST action=caldav_forget                            -> take our events back, forget the sign-in
 *
 * 🔑 ANY NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS. An install can have Microsoft 365 and one or
 * more CalDAV servers side by side, and each analyst picks the one their work
 * goes to. connection_id may be left out while there is only one, or to mean
 * "the one I already use".
 *
 * 🔴 WITH MICROSOFT THIS ENDPOINT CANNOT SET AN ADDRESS. Only mode. The
 * application permission behind that push can write to any mailbox in the
 * tenant, so letting an analyst name their own target would let them fill a
 * colleague's calendar with their tickets. Where it goes is an administrator's
 * decision (System → Calendar sync); whether it happens at all is the analyst's.
 *
 * 🔑 WITH CALDAV IT CAN, AND MUST. Each calendar belongs to its owner's account
 * and FreeITSM signs in with the analyst's own password, so the only calendars
 * it can reach are ones they could already write to - and nobody else has the
 * password to choose for them. The calendar must still be on the server the
 * administrator configured (CalDavCalendarProvider::calendarUrl).
 *
 * 🔑 ONE MODE, NOT TWO SWITCHES. With a push and a subscribed feed both live you
 * see every scheduled ticket twice — once as a real event, once from the
 * subscription. A single value makes that unrepresentable.
