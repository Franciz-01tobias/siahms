/**
 * Serve a document attached to a knowledge article, to a portal requester who
 * may read that article in the Help Centre (GH #177).
 *
 * The portal twin of api/documents/download.php for ARTICLES, as
 * get_document.php is for shared ticket notes. Kept as its own endpoint rather
 * than a branch of that one: the two answer different questions ("did you raise
 * this ticket" against "may you read this article"), and each is easier to
 * trust when it answers exactly one.
 *
 * Every refusal is the same 404 - a wrong id, a hidden document, an article in
 * another company, an internal article, a document that is only on a contract -
 * so ids cannot be used to learn what exists. The decision is
 * helpCentreDocumentForPortalUser(); this file only serves what it returns.
