/**
 * API: close your own ticket from the Self-Service Portal.
 * POST { ticket_id, reason? }
 *
 * For the commonest wasted ticket on any desk: "it started working", "I sorted
 * it myself", "I raised this twice". Without this the requester either replies
 * asking somebody to close it - which costs an analyst a round trip to do
 * nothing - or says nothing and the ticket ages in a queue.
 *
 * 🔑 IT GOES THROUGH TicketsService::updateTicket LIKE EVERY OTHER CLOSURE.
 * Closing is not one UPDATE: it stamps closed_datetime, stops the SLA, fires
 * the ticket_closed template, may trigger the CSAT survey, dispatches the
 * ticket.closed workflow event, and is refused by a blocking checklist gate. A
 * second closure path here would get some of that and silently skip the rest.
 *
 * 🔴 Off unless an administrator turns it on (System → Self-service portal),
 * and the switch is re-checked here - the button being hidden is not a rule.
