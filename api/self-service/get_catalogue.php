/**
 * API: the request catalogue — forms offered to customers in the portal.
 *
 * Two gates, both required:
 *   is_portal_visible = 1  — someone deliberately offered this form to
 *                            customers. Defaults to 0, so an upgrade never
 *                            exposes an existing internal form (a new-starter
 *                            request a manager fills in is `is_active`, but has
 *                            no business being on a customer's menu).
 *   is_active = 1          — the analyst-side on/off, unchanged.
 *
 * Forms are VERSIONED: each row is one snapshot, chained by parent_form_id, and
 * the LEAF (no children) is the current one. The catalogue lists leaves only,
 * exactly as the analyst list does — otherwise every past revision of a form
 * would appear as a separate thing to request.
 *
 * ⚠️ Forms are NOT multi-company yet (no tenant_id on any forms table), so this
 * catalogue is the same for every company. That is a known limitation, not an
 * oversight — see the module's multi-tenancy work.
