/**
 * Search panel dismissal — Escape, and optionally clicking away (GH #144).
 *
 * Reported by mbsouth: the search panel should close when you click a result or
 * click outside it. Clicking a result is already the behaviour in Change
 * Management, Problem Management and Contracts, because in those modules the
 * result opens a detail view that takes over the screen. Tickets deliberately
 * keeps the panel open — its results load into the reading pane BESIDE the
 * panel, so you can click down a list of candidates without searching again.
 * That is a real working style, so it is left alone.
 *
 * What this file adds:
 *   1. Escape closes the panel. No setting — three of the four modules were
 *      missing it and nobody wants Escape not to work.
 *   2. Clicking away closes the panel, IF the analyst asked for it
 *      (System > Preferences > Display; window.SEARCH_PANEL_CLOSE_OUTSIDE).
 *
 * 🔑 Why "outside" is not simply "not the panel". Ed's objection, and it is the
 * right one: you find a ticket, then click its Properties to change something —
 * a literal reading of "outside" would close your search at exactly the moment
 * you were acting on its result. So the click tells us the intent:
 *   - the ticket you just opened (the reading pane, properties included) is
 *     INSIDE: you are working on what the search gave you;
 *   - the folder pane, the ticket list, the toolbar and bare page chrome are
 *     OUTSIDE: you have moved on.
 * Anything else on top (a confirm dialog, a toast) is also treated as inside,
 * because a click there is aimed at that thing, not at dismissing a panel
 * behind it.
 *
 * Registration is per module: each calls initSearchPanelDismiss() with its own
 * panel and close function, since the panels have different ids and the modules
 * do not share a close routine.
