/**
 * Copying text to the clipboard, in the one place.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO FIX. Twelve places called
 * `navigator.clipboard.writeText(x).then(...).catch(...)` directly, and ten of
 * them did not check that `navigator.clipboard` was there at all. It is absent
 * outside a secure context — plain HTTP, or HTTPS with a certificate the phone
 * does not trust, which is exactly the situation of a self-hosted server on an
 * internal name. Reading `.writeText` of `undefined` throws SYNCHRONOUSLY, so
 * the `.catch()` never runs: the fallback never fired, no message appeared, and
 * nothing was copied. Ed hit it sharing a Knowledge link from an iPhone.
 *
 * Two further things this gets right that the old inline copies did not:
 *
 *  1. iOS Safari ignores `input.select()`. Selecting text there needs a Range
 *     over the node plus `setSelectionRange`, and the element must be a real,
 *     rendered, readonly field — not `display: none`, not zero-opacity-with-no-
 *     size. A 16px font stops iOS zooming the page while it is focused.
 *
 *  2. IT NEVER CLAIMS SUCCESS IT DID NOT HAVE. The old fallback ran
 *     `execCommand('copy')`, ignored the false it can return, and showed
 *     "Copied!" regardless. Being told something is on your clipboard when it
 *     is not is worse than being told the copy failed, because you only find
 *     out when you paste somewhere else and lose whatever you were doing.
 *
 * Resolves to true only if the text really was copied.
